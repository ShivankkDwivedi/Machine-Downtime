# Machine Downtime Optimization Project
üìñ Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing machine downtime using data analytics techniques. The primary objective was to identify patterns, root causes, and actionable insights to minimize downtime and improve operational efficiency in a manufacturing environment.

## Due to company policy, the dataset is not uploaded, but this repository contains:
- Project Architecture (PNG)
- Data Analyst Checklist
- Research Tracker (with problem definitions and sources)
- Presentation Deck summarizing the end-to-end approach

## Project Objectives

- Business Problem: Excessive machine downtime leading to production loss and reduced efficiency.
- Goal: Reduce downtime by identifying root causes and providing data-driven solutions.
- Success Criteria: Achieve accurate downtime prediction and generate recommendations for maintenance and process improvements.

## Project Architecture
- The architecture diagram (uploaded as architecture.png) illustrates:
- Data Collection: Machine logs, operational data
- Data Storage: MySQL database for structured data
- Data Analysis: SQL for EDA and statistical analysis
- Visualization: Power BI for interactive dashboards
- Insights & Recommendations: Actionable strategies for reducing downtime


## üîç Approach & Methodology
### 1. Data Collection & Preparation
Gathered machine downtime data (not included in repo due to company policy)
Cleaned and structured data for SQL-based analysis

### 2. Database Integration
Uploaded dataset into MySQL
Created tables and ensured proper data types for analysis

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed in SQL to calculate:
Statistical Moments: Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation
Range, Skewness, Kurtosis for each column
Outlier detection and trend analysis

### 4. Visualization & Reporting
Built Power BI dashboards for downtime trends, machine performance, and root cause analysis

### 5. Insights & Recommendations
Identified frequent downtime causes
Suggested preventive maintenance strategies
Proposed scheduling improvements for optimal production

## üìä Tools & Technologies
Database: MySQL
Data Analysis: SQL (with aggregation & statistical functions)
Visualization: Power BI
Documentation & Tracking: Excel, PPT

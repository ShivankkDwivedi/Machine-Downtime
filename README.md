# Machine Downtime Optimization Project
📖 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing machine downtime using data analytics techniques. The primary objective was to identify patterns, root causes, and actionable insights to minimize downtime and improve operational efficiency in a manufacturing environment.

## Due to company policy, the dataset is not uploaded, but this repository contains:
- Project Architecture (PNG)
- Data Analyst Checklist
- Research Tracker (with problem definitions and sources)
- Presentation Deck summarizing the end-to-end approach

## Project Objectives

- Business Problem: Excessive machine downtime leading to production loss and reduced efficiency.

- Goal: Reduce downtime by identifying root causes and providing data-driven solutions.

- Success Criteria: Achieve accurate downtime prediction and generate recommendations for maintenance and process improvements.

🔍 Approach & Methodology
1. Data Collection & Preparation
Gathered machine downtime data (not included in repo due to company policy)

Cleaned and structured data for SQL-based analysis

2. Database Integration
Uploaded dataset into MySQL

Created tables and ensured proper data types for analysis

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed in SQL to calculate:

Statistical Moments: Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation

Range, Skewness, Kurtosis for each column

Outlier detection and trend analysis

4. Visualization & Reporting
Built Power BI dashboards for downtime trends, machine performance, and root cause analysis

5. Insights & Recommendations
Identified frequent downtime causes

Suggested preventive maintenance strategies

Proposed scheduling improvements for optimal production

📊 Tools & Technologies
Database: MySQL

Data Analysis: SQL (with aggregation & statistical functions)

Visualization: Power BI

Documentation & Tracking: Excel, PPT

📜 Research & References
Included in Research_Tracker.xlsx with details on sources and solutions considered

⚠ Note
The actual dataset is not provided in this repository due to company confidentiality policies. However, all steps, methodology, and architecture are documented for reference.
